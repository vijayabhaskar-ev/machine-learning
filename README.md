Overview

This repository contains code and experiments from my journey of learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) from the ground up. The primary goal is to gain a deep understanding of AI concepts, algorithms, and implementations without relying heavily on high-level frameworks.
Purpose



Educational:

This project serves as a personal learning resource and may be helpful for others embarking on a similar journey.
Skill Development: By implementing AI algorithms from scratch, I aim to strengthen my programming skills and deepen my understanding of the underlying mathematics and principles of AI.


Contents
The repository includes:

Implementations of fundamental ML algorithms
Experiments with various datasets
Notes and insights gained during the learning process
Gradually increasing complexity as my understanding grows
