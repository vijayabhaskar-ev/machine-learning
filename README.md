Overview
This repository contains code and experiments from my journey of learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) from the ground up. The primary goal is to gain a deep understanding of AI concepts, algorithms, and implementations without relying heavily on high-level frameworks.
Purpose

Educational: This project serves as a personal learning resource and may be helpful for others embarking on a similar journey.
Skill Development: By implementing AI algorithms from scratch, I aim to strengthen my programming skills and deepen my understanding of the underlying mathematics and principles of AI.


Contents
The repository includes:

Implementations of fundamental ML algorithms
Experiments with various datasets
Notes and insights gained during the learning process
Gradually increasing complexity as my understanding grows

Note to Recruiters and Fellow Learners
While this project is primarily for learning purposes, it demonstrates my commitment to understanding AI at a fundamental level. The code here may not be production-ready but illustrates my problem-solving approach and willingness to tackle complex topics.
Ongoing Development
This is an active learning project. The contents will evolve as I progress through different AI and ML concepts. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
